# Welcome to the contest!

Today you'll be battling against other teams, viaing for supremacy in the ultimate game of hand-to-hand combat -- Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock!

In case you are not familiar with this timeless classic, you'll find [the rules of the game](http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html) a good starting point.

Your team's job is to create a "bot" that can play RPSLS. Your bot will compete against bots from other teams until only one is left standing. [There are some basic requirements](https://confluence.oreillyauto.com/display/~PTHOMPSO8/RPSLS) for each bot, but you are free to implement the main function, `play()` however you'd like in an effort to gain dominance over your opponents.

## Getting Started

First, clone this repository and then create a new branch with your team name. Next, you'll need to copy/create the folder structure under `contestants/NewBot`. Name your folder after your team. Inside this folder you need `CSS` and `IMGS` folders, and a .js file named after your team. You'll find a stubbed version of a robot in `NewBot/robot.js`. 

Next, implement your bot.

You'll need to adjust the index.js file to import your bot and add it to the list of players. To practice, have your bot play against itself!

When you're ready, fire up a terminal and navigate to the project directory. If your system does not have a http server, install one. We recommend http-server which can be installed via `npm i http-server`. Open a browser window and load localhost:8080 to run the game. 



## Advanced Options

You can choose to train your bot on the training page.
